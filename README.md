## üéÆ Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Minimax Implementation)

This project allows you to play Tic-Tac-Toe against an unbeatable AI using the Minimax algorithm.
The AI always plays optimally, so if both you and the AI play perfectly, the game will always end in a tie.

##  üìñ Overview

This program implements a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game with AI:

Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.

The first player to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.

The game ends in a tie if all cells are filled without a winner.

The AI uses Minimax, a recursive decision-making algorithm, to determine the optimal move.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The project contains two main Python files:

1. **tictactoe.py** ‚Äì Core game logic and AI:

    - `player(board)`: Determines whose turn it is (`X` or `O`).  
    - `actions(board)`: Returns a set of all possible moves `(i, j)` on the board.  
    - `result(board, action)`: Returns a new board after making a move.  
    - `winner(board)`: Returns the winner (`X`, `O`, or `None`).  
    - `terminal(board)`: Returns `True` if the game is over.  
    - `utility(board)`: Returns `1` if X wins, `-1` if O wins, `0` for a tie.  
    - `minimax(board)`: Returns the optimal action `(i, j)` for the current player.

2. **runner.py** ‚Äì Pygame-based graphical interface:

    - Displays the board and moves.  
    - Handles user input via mouse clicks.  
    - Shows current game status and winner.  
    - Allows restarting the game after it ends.

## üß† Algorithm Details

### Minimax Algorithm

The **Minimax algorithm** ensures the AI plays optimally:

- **Maximizing player (X)** tries to maximize the score.  
- **Minimizing player (O)** tries to minimize the score.  

---

### Utility Values

- **`+1`‚Üí X wins**  
- **`‚àí1` ‚Üí O wins**  
- **`0` ‚Üí Tie**
---
### Logic Flow

1. Check if the board is in a terminal state.  
2. Generate all possible moves.  
3. Recursively evaluate each move:  
   - Maximize the score if it's X's turn.  
   - Minimize the score if it's O's turn.  
4. Return the move that leads to the optimal outcome.

### üß© Board Representation

The board is represented as a **3x3 2D list** in Python:

```python
board = [
    [X, O, None],
    [None, X, O],
    [O, None, X]
]

```
- `X` and `O` represent players.
- `None` represents an empty cell.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

**1. Clone the repository**
```python
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
cd tic-tac-toe-ai
```
**2. Install dependencies**
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**requirements.txt**
```python
pygame==2.6.0
```
**3. Run the game**
```python
python runner.py
```
**4. Gameplay**
- Choose your player: `X` or `O`.
- Click on an empty square to place your move.
- The AI responds automatically with the optimal move.
- When the game ends, you will see:
    "Game Over: X wins."
    "Game Over: O wins."
    "Game Over: Tie."
- Click **‚ÄúPlay Again‚Äù** to restart the game.

### üìäExample Gameplay
```python
Choose your player: X
You place X in the top-left corner
Computer places O in the center
You place X in the top-center
Computer places O in the bottom-right
...
Game Over: Tie
``` 
### üí° Notes

- The AI cannot be beaten; it will always play optimally.
- The game handles full boards and detects ties automatically.
- Minimax uses deep copies to ensure the original board is not modified during recursion.
- You can test the logic without the GUI by using tictactoe.py functions directly.

### üß© Dependencies / Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pygame (pip install pygame)
- No other external libraries required
